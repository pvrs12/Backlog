# Backlog

* This project is a program for tracking tasks to be completed.
* The tasks are sorted by due date and colored red if they are past due
* As tasks are completed they are removed from the backlog
* Files can be associated with a task, when the task is double clicked, the file will open
* There multiple 'task-files' can be used to keep track of seperate sets of tasks (like work/home)
* The program has no taskbar icon and will remain beneath any other programs you have
* A systemtray icon also exists (stolen from the SystemMonitor icon...)
